char (*arr)[5] is a pointer to an array of 5 chars... I think 

char *(arr[5]) is just an array of 5 pointers to char


char *(arr[5]) equals to char *arr[5] and it means you have array of pointers 
that each of them points to a character 

so arr[0] can points to a character and arr[1] can points to a character and so on. 

For example you can write your code like this:

char *(arr[5]);// or char *arr[5]
char a = 'a',b='b',c='c';
arr[0] = &a;
arr[1] = &b;
arr[2] = &c;    
printf("a=%c b=%c c=%c \n",*arr[0],*arr[1],*arr[2]);

But (*arr)[5] means you have an array of 5 characters and you want to point it.
For example you can write your code like this:

char (*arr)[5];
char str[5] = "Hell";
arr = &str;
printf("%s\n",*arr);
